# UML-Diagram-Maker
A program for creating beautiful UML Diagrams. School project in the course GUI Programming during early 2016.

We created a WPF application for creating UML diagrams in a easy way. We gave the user interface a lot of thought, 
user experience was the biggest and most important aspect in the course. 

Unfortunately the original repository is hosted on a friends Github profile, you can check it out below to see all
